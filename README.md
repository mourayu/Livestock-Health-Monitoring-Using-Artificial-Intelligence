# Livestock-Health-Monitoring-Using-Artificial-Intelligence
This paper we explaines the methodology for using AI in livestock health monitoring involves 
first installing the necessary sensors and cameras in the animals' living environments. Using 
such equipment data is collected on the animals such as their behaviour, body temperature, and 
heart rate. This data is then fed into machine learning algorithms, which can analyze it to detect 
potential signs of illness or other health issues.
Comparison between all the existing Artificial Intelligence 
technologies has been discussed. With the help of comparison, a best fit product is proposed for 
the usage in livestock to monitor the health and also for other purposes. Usingvarious machine 
learning algorithms, an efficient model is made for the project.
